Statistical data analysis of a telecom operator's clients
We work as an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.
We are going to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018.
We will analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.
